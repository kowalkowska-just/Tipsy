# Tipsy
## Tip Calculator App
### This application is used to calculate the split of the bill. 
### You can choose:
- How much do you want to tip (0%, 10% or 20%),
- For how many people do you want to split this bill.

### In this project I learned about:
- How to create multi-screen app with animated navigation, 
- How to create a new Cocoa Touch Class, 
- How to use UITextField and UIStepper,
- Pass by value vs. pass by reference,
- MVC design patter.
